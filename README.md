MIDI Shape Player

   This application was a final project for the Data Abstraction course as a part of the Software Development MicroMaster Program offered by the University of British Columbia.
   
   The purpose of this assigment was to practice applying polymorphism, inheritance, and SOLID Design Prinicples such as Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, and Liskov Substitution to an actual codebase. As such, a fully functional application was provided and I was tasked with extending the functionality of the application. Specifically, I needed to create a new shape that could be drawn and played within the application in addition to the original rectangle shape.
